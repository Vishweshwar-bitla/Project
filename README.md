**File Encryption System**
  A Software which tries to converts the originality of the text into some encrypted form is called File Security System. The main objective of this proposed system is to provide the flexibility of transferring the information to the user, to implement the encryption standards as per the proposed algorithms & specification and store the important information in a form that is unreadable by the unauthorized users. The proposed system should have a reversal process and when the user makes proper request, this process will decrypt the encrypted data to its original format. After Encryption and Decryption of data is done, this system should confirm the authorization of the user and the standards of authentication.


  The application asks the user to provide Encryption Key details and it should start its functionality based on the logistics that are provided with this key. At the other end, the Decryption application must be a reverse process and should be translated only when the receiver of the data applies the proper reversal key.  
The performance is achieved with the help of on-demand 
computing concept which is that we are going to encrypt all files. It saves the performance overhead of the system. So the complete system is a highly independent of the configuration.
